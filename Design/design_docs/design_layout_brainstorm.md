The purpose of this document is to brainstorm the layout of the design for the project. This will include the layout of the components and the overall design of the project. This will include possible sections for each page and what elements should be included in each. This will aid in the creation of wireframes and prototypes for the project.

## Site Intent

Due to how quickly end-user bounce can occur, the home page / landing page should be designed to quickly and effectively communicate the purpose of the site. The user should be able to quickly understand what the site is about and what they can do on the site. The user should be able to quickly navigate to the most important sections of the site. A clear navigation of the site should be present on the home page and there should be multiple avenues for the user to navigate to the most important sections of the site.

## Home Page

The home page will be the first page that the user sees when they visit the site. It should be designed to quickly provide the user with items they may purchase. This could be by means of suggestion or history of searching. The home page should also provide a way for the user to quickly find products they are looking for. This should be down though multiple means including: categories, product images and names, and others.

### Required sections

- **Header**
    - *Logo*: <br>the logo of the company the site was made for. This should be clickable and take the user to the home page. The image should be a .svg so that it can be scaled to any size.
    - *Nav bar*:<br>The nav bar should contain links to the most common categories to easy allow the user to find desired products.
    - *Search Bar*:<br>The search bar will allow the user to search for products by name or category.
    - *Login / Register / Profile*:<br>This will switch depending on if the user is logged in or not. A circle with the first letter of the user's username will be displayed if the user is logged in. If the user is not logged in, a login and register button will be displayed.
    - *Cart*:<br>An icon representing the user's cart will be displayed. If the user has items in their cart, a number will be displayed next to the icon representing the number of items in the cart.
- **Hero**
    - *Carousel*: <br>A carousel of images of products that the user may be interested in. This will be clickable and will take the user to the product page. This should  include any sales or specials the website is having.
- **For You**
    - *Product Suggestion Cards*: <br>These will be cards that display a product that the user may be interested in. This will be based on the user's search history and other factors. The user will be able to click on the card to go to the product page. If the user is not logged in, the cards will be random.
- **Categories**
    - *Category Cards*: <br>These will be cards that display a category of products. The user will be able to click on the card to go to the category page.
- **Footer**
